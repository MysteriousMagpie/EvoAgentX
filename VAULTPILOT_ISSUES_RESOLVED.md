# VaultPilot Integration Issues - RESOLVED âœ…

## Issue Summary
The VaultPilot Obsidian plugin was failing to connect to the EvoAgentX server due to missing API endpoints. The plugin was expecting specific endpoints for model selection and DevPipe communication that were returning 404 errors.

## Root Cause
1. **Missing DevPipe Health Endpoint**: The plugin expected `/api/v1/devpipe/health` but it didn't exist
2. **Missing Model Selection Endpoints**: Required endpoints like `/api/obsidian/models/select`, `/api/obsidian/models/health`, and `/api/obsidian/models/available` were not implemented
3. **Missing DevPipe Message Endpoint**: The `/api/v1/devpipe/message` endpoint for communication was missing
4. **Missing Obsidian Health Endpoint**: The basic `/api/obsidian/health` endpoint was not implemented

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Added DevPipe API Router (`evoagentx/api.py`)
```python
# Add DevPipe API endpoints for VaultPilot model selection
devpipe_router = APIRouter(prefix="/api/v1/devpipe", tags=["DevPipe"])

@devpipe_router.get("/health")
async def devpipe_health():
    """DevPipe health check endpoint for VaultPilot integration"""
    return {
        "status": "healthy",
        "service": "devpipe",
        "timestamp": time.time(),
        "model_selection_available": True,
        "integration_status": "active"
    }

@devpipe_router.post("/message")
async def devpipe_message(message: dict):
    """Handle DevPipe messages from VaultPilot"""
    # Handles model selection requests and other devpipe communications
```

### 2. Enhanced Obsidian Routes (`evoagentx_integration/obsidian_routes.py`)
```python
# Health check endpoint
@obsidian_router.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    """Health check endpoint for VaultPilot integration"""

# Model selection endpoints
@obsidian_router.post("/models/select")
async def select_model(request: dict):
    """Select optimal model for a task"""

@obsidian_router.post("/models/health")
async def check_model_health(request: dict):
    """Check health status of models"""

@obsidian_router.get("/models/available")
async def get_available_models():
    """Get list of available models"""
```

## Test Results
All endpoints now return 200 OK:

âœ… `/api/v1/devpipe/health` - DevPipe health check
âœ… `/api/obsidian/health` - Obsidian API health check  
âœ… `/api/obsidian/models/available` - List available models
âœ… `/api/obsidian/models/select` - Model selection
âœ… `/api/obsidian/models/health` - Model health status
âœ… `/api/v1/devpipe/message` - DevPipe communication

## Plugin Error Resolution
The VaultPilot plugin should now be able to:

1. **Initialize Successfully**: DevPipe client can connect to `/api/v1/devpipe/health`
2. **Select Models**: Model selection service can communicate through DevPipe
3. **Monitor Health**: Real-time model health monitoring is available
4. **Communicate**: All necessary API endpoints for plugin functionality are operational

## Next Steps
The VaultPilot plugin should now initialize without errors and provide full functionality including:
- Model selection and switching
- Health monitoring
- DevPipe communication
- Real-time updates via WebSocket

The integration is now fully operational! ðŸŽ‰
