└── vault-management.css        # Styling for new components
```

## 🔧 Integration Points

### Settings Integration
Add vault management preferences to your existing settings:
- Enable/disable vault management features
- Configure search result limits
- Set batch operation timeouts
- Customize UI preferences

### Command Palette Integration
Register new commands for quick access:
- View Vault Structure
- Smart Vault Search
- File Operations Manager
- AI Vault Organization
- Batch File Operations

### Sidebar Integration
Enhance your sidebar view with:
- Vault statistics display
- Quick action buttons
- Real-time structure updates
- Connection status indicators

### WebSocket Integration
Optional real-time features:
- Live vault structure updates
- Real-time search results
- Operation progress tracking
- Collaborative editing notifications

## 🛡️ Error Handling Strategy

Implement comprehensive error handling for:
- Network connectivity issues
- Backend service unavailability
- File system permission errors
- Invalid operation parameters
- Batch operation failures

## 🎨 User Experience Guidelines

### Progressive Enhancement
- Core functionality works without vault management
- Graceful degradation when backend unavailable
- Clear loading states and progress indicators
- Informative error messages and recovery suggestions

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load vault structure data
- Implement search result pagination
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Optimize batch operations

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode support
- Consistent focus management

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Basic Structure Analysis
```typescript
const structure = await apiClient.getVaultStructure({
  include_content: false,
  max_depth: 3
});
```

### Smart Search
```typescript
const results = await apiClient.searchVault({
  query: "machine learning concepts",
  search_type: "content",
  max_results: 20
});
```

### File Operations
```typescript
const result = await apiClient.createFile(
  "Projects/New Research.md",
  "# New Research Project\n\nStarted: " + new Date()
);
```

### Batch Operations
```typescript
const batchResult = await apiClient.performBatchFileOperations({
  operations: [
    { operation: "create", file_path: "note1.md", content: "Content 1" },
    { operation: "move", file_path: "old.md", destination_path: "archive/old.md" }
  ],
  continue_on_error: true
});
```

## 🔄 Migration Guide

### From Existing VaultPilot
1. Backup your current plugin configuration
2. Add new type definitions
3. Extend API client incrementally
4. Test each modal component individually
5. Update settings and commands last

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit test API client methods
2. Integration test with EvoAgentX backend
3. User acceptance testing with real vaults
4. Performance testing with large vaults
5. Error scenario testing

## 📚 Additional Resources

- **EvoAgentX Documentation**: Backend API specifications
- **Obsidian Plugin API**: Official plugin development guide
- **TypeScript Handbook**: Language reference and best practices
- **Testing Guide**: Comprehensive testing strategies

## 🆘 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Connection Failures**: Check backend URL and network connectivity
- **Permission Errors**: Verify file system access and Obsidian permissions
- **Performance Issues**: Optimize queries and implement caching
- **UI Responsiveness**: Use async operations and loading states

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging for detailed troubleshooting:
```typescript
console.log('Vault management debug info:', {
  backendUrl: settings.serverUrl,
  features: settings.enableVaultManagement,
  connectivity: await testConnection()
});
```

---

**Next Steps**: Proceed to implement the components in the following order for optimal development experience:
1. Types and API client extensions
2. Basic modals (structure and search)
3. Advanced modals (operations and organization)
4. UI enhancements and styling
5. Testing and optimization
